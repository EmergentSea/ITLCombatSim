# ITLCombatSim
Player1, Player2, and Weapons are necessary files for the program to run properly,
while the templates are there in case you want to edit those files to make the program run differently.
The ITLCombatSimMap file is recommended to have open while running the program, as it has some
explanation of things like the coordinate grid used. Note that while the map on that file is limited, 
the actual map used by the program is (effectively) not.
Also, please be aware that this is my first major project, and the code will therefore be extremely
sloppy, and rather inconsistent at times, especially since this is my first project which uses multiple
classes, not just the first major one.
